# :art: Image Prompts

A public, curated gallery of AI-generated image prompts with example outputs. Each prompt folder includes a `prompt.md` file (copy-ready) and at least one demo image so you can quickly preview the result.

## :sparkles: What you'll find here

- :jigsaw: Reusable prompts (structured + consistent)
- :frame_with_picture: Example images alongside each prompt
- :file_folder: Clean folder-per-prompt organization for easy browsing

## :open_file_folder: Structure

Each prompt is stored in:

`/images/<prompt name>/`

Recommended contents:

- `prompt.md` - the prompt text (Markdown)
- `demo.png` / `demo.jpg` (or similar) - an example output image

## :rocket: How to use

1. Open a prompt from the index below.
2. Open `prompt.md`.
3. Use the GitHub copy button on the code block to copy the prompt in one click.
