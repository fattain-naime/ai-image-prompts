Upload: 3–5 separate portrait photos of different people from the team.

Create a single professional group photo that looks like everyone was physically together.

Scene: Modern office conference room with large windows and a city view. Natural afternoon light entering from the left.

Arrange all people around a conference table in a natural meeting pose: some sitting, one standing and presenting, casual but professional. Match lighting direction and intensity across all faces. Keep each person’s outfit, hairstyle, and appearance exactly as in their reference photo.

Ensure shadows, reflections on the table, and perspective are consistent. The final image should look like a real corporate photo, not a collage. 4K resolution, landscape orientation.
