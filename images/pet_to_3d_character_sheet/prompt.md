Upload: 3–4 clear photos of your pet from different angles.

Create a professional character design sheet of this pet as a 3D animated character.

Include:
- Front view
- Side profile
- 3/4 view
- Back view
- Close‑up of the face showing expression
- A small walking animation pose lineup

Keep the pet’s exact coloring, markings, and unique features consistent across all angles. Use a Pixar/Disney‑style 3D look with clean cel‑shading. Include a small color palette with hex codes for the main fur and eye colors.

Use a clean white background with a subtle grid. Add the character’s name at the top. 4K resolution, suitable for a pitch deck.
