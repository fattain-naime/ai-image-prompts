Upload: A high‑quality photo of your product (e.g., smartwatch).

Create 6 professional product photos of this exact smartwatch, keeping its design, color, screen content, and any wear patterns completely consistent.

Scenes:
1) Clean white background, front‑facing e‑commerce shot with soft front lighting.
2) Wooden desk with a journal and pen, daylight from a window on the left.
3) Gym bench with towel and water bottle, dramatic side lighting.
4) Car dashboard next to car keys, dashboard lights glowing softly.
5) Outdoor granite rock with hiking boots in the background, overcast daylight.
6) Dinner table with wine glass and menu, warm candlelight ambiance.

In every scene, adjust only the environment and lighting style. The smartwatch must look identical in shape, color, reflections, and screen display. 4K resolution, square 1:1 aspect ratio suitable for Instagram carousels.
