Upload: 8–10 reference images showing colors, textures, lighting, furniture, plants, and art styles you like.

Synthesize all these references into a single cohesive interior design for a coffee shop.

Combine:
- The color palette from image 1 (warm terracottas and deep greens).
- The wood texture and grain from image 2.
- The soft, intimate lighting mood from image 3.
- The furniture style from image 4 (mid‑century modern).
- The plant placement approach from image 5.
- The wall art aesthetic from images 6 and 7.
- The overall cozy, sophisticated vibe from images 8–10.

Scene:
Main seating area with 4 small tables, one long community table, an espresso bar in the background, and large windows with natural light. Add plants throughout. View from a corner with a wide angle, showing most of the space. Photorealistic architectural visualization, 4K resolution, presentation‑ready.
