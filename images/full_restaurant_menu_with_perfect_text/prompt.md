Design a modern steakhouse menu for “Ember & Oak Steakhouse.”

Pages:

3) Desserts – 4 items with wine pairing suggestions

Design:
- Black background with gold accents
- Dish names in elegant serif font
- Descriptions in clean sans‑serif font
- Prices right‑aligned
- Small icons for dietary restrictions (GF, V, VG)

Layout each page to 8.5×11 inches at 300 DPI (print‑ready). Make every letter sharp and readable: dish names, descriptions, prices, footnotes, and section titles.
