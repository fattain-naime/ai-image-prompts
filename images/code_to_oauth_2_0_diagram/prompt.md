```text
Upload: Screenshot of your code or a rough system sketch for OAuth 2.0.

Turn this into a clean OAuth 2.0 flow diagram for technical documentation.

Include these exact components:
- User
- Client App
- Authorization Server
- Resource Server

Use color coding:
- User actions: blue (#2196F3)
- Successful responses: green (#4CAF50)
- Authorization steps: orange (#FF9800)

Add labeled arrows:
1) Authorization Request
2) Authorization Grant
3) Access Token Request
4) Access Token
5) Protected Resource Request
6) Protected Resource

Use a modern, minimalist design with plenty of white space. Include small code snippet callouts in monospace font near key arrows. Export at 2000×2000, optimized for slides and docs.
