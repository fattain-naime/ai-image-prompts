Create an educational infographic comparing the diameters of the 8 planets in our solar system using these values (in km):

Mercury 4,879
Venus 12,104
Earth 12,756
Mars 6,792
Jupiter 142,984
Saturn 120,536
Uranus 51,118
Neptune 49,528

Show all 8 planets to scale relative to each other, arranged horizontally in order from the Sun. Use scientifically accurate colors and textures for each planet.

Label each planet with its name and exact diameter in a clean sans‑serif font. Add a scale bar labeled “10,000 km” for reference and a title at the top: “Solar System Planet Size Comparison”.

Background: deep space black with subtle stars. Poster size: 24×36 inches, 300 DPI, suitable for classroom printing.
