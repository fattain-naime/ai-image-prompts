Upload: Rough pencil sketch of a logo idea on paper.

Turn this rough logo sketch into 8 professional logo variations:
1) Minimalist black line art on white.
2) Gradient blue‑to‑purple modern tech style.
3) Vintage badge with subtle distressed texture.
4) Neon glow logo on a dark background.
5) Watercolor artistic interpretation with soft edges.
6) Bold geometric version with simplified shapes.
7) Gold foil embossed look on dark card stock.
8) Hand‑lettered organic style with natural curves.

Keep the core logo concept and symbol recognizable in every variation, but explore clearly different visual directions. Present all 8 versions in a 4×2 grid, each variation clearly separated with a small label beneath it. High resolution, 4K, suitable for client presentations.
