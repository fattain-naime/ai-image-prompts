Search the web for today’s top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. Get their current prices and 24‑hour percentage changes.

Create a dark‑themed financial dashboard inspired by professional trading terminals:
- Deep blue‑black background
- Green accents for positive changes
- Red accents for negative changes

For each cryptocurrency, show:
- Name and ticker
- Current price (large text)
- 24‑hour percent change
- A small 7‑day sparkline chart

Layout everything in a 16:9 dashboard suitable for presentation slides. Add a subtle grid in the background and a small “Last updated: [current date & time]” label at the bottom. 4K resolution.
